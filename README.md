### Hi there 👋
I'm Gift and I am just an [A]ctual [I]diot trying to make AIs (See what I did there 😂😐)

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Django E-commerce Website
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Django, Keras, ML, DL, AI, Python (One at a time tho)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on creating a generic AI that can (but won't) pass the turing test 👀
- 💬 Ask me about anything concerning python and programming in general 
- 📫 How to reach me: giftabumere247@gmail.com
- visit my website: gift-py.netlify.app (Don't be too harsh on my handwork 😅😪)

My Skill Set?...  🤔🤔
